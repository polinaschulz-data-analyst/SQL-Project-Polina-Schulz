# SQL-Project-Polina-Schulz
Hello, I am Polina Schulz, Data Analyst

Welcome to my SQL project!

In this repository, I present an SQL project that demonstrates my skills in working with SQL.

The project is structured so that you can directly view my SQL code. Additionally, I have included screenshots that display the results of the SQL queries.

The source data is publicly available in Google BigQuery and can be viewed live there.

Enjoy exploring, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

Firstly I would like to show the data structur in the file:
#

select *
from `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*` as ga4
limit 10
;
